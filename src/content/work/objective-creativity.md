### Project Overview

This Objective Creativity project used structured, goal-driven design to turn a common toilet plunger into powerful communication images, focusing on clarity, impact, and message over subjective style.

**Approach:** I analyzed the object's form and associations, ideated concepts for clear messaging, and iterated for maximum visual strength.

**Tools:** AI image generation/editing, Photoshop, and InDesign.

### Final Designs

The resulting images demonstrate how objective creativity and the use of creative strategies transform an everyday item into effective visual storytelling.
