### Project Description

This project is a creative exploration for the album cover of *Frenesi* by Artie Shaw. The design translates the energy, rhythm, and mood of the music into a cohesive visual identity, using original illustrations and typographic choices to capture the album's lively and expressive character.

### Design Process

The process began with listening to the music to understand its tone, tempo, and emotion. Sketches and digital illustration experiments were used to explore composition, color, and typography, ultimately creating a cover that visually reflects the dynamic spirit of the album while remaining bold, memorable, and harmonious.
