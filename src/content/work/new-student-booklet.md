This campus booklet project showcases the key buildings and facilities at BYU-Idaho, designed to help new students navigate and understand the campus layout. The booklet features a comprehensive campus map and detailed writeups of four significant buildings that form the heart of student life at BYU-Idaho.

The booklet's design incorporates a clean, modern aesthetic with a color-coded map system for easy navigation. Each building section includes student testimonials and high-quality photographs that capture both the architectural features and the dynamic student life within these spaces. This project demonstrates my ability to combine graphic design principles with informative content to create a practical and visually appealing guide for the campus community.
