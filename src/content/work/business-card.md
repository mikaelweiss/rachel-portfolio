### Project Description

This project is a personal business card featuring a hand-lettered typogram of my name, created to represent a fictitious apparel company. The design balances elegance, readability, and personality, serving as a concise visual introduction to my work and creative identity.

### Design Process

The process began with sketching and experimenting with letterforms to develop a unique and cohesive typogram. Refinement in digital format focused on scale, spacing, and composition, resulting in a distinctive business card that merges craftsmanship with professional branding.
