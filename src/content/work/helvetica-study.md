### Project Description

This project is a typographical poster exploring the iconic typeface Helvetica. The design emphasizes form, proportion, and hierarchy, showcasing the versatility and clarity of the typeface while creating a visually engaging composition that communicates balance and structure.

### Design Process

The process began with research on Helvetica's history, characteristics, and applications. Digital layout experiments were used to explore hierarchy, spacing, and scale, resulting in a poster that highlights the beauty and functionality of the typeface while demonstrating thoughtful typographic decision-making.

I also did a Type-Shape study to really hone in on my skills with negative space and the use of letter forms as graphics.
