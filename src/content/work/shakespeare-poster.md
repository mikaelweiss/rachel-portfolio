### Project Overview

This poster for *The Taming of the Shrew* features my own original illustrations to bring the play's humor, wit, and lively characters to life. Typography, color, and layout were carefully designed to guide the viewer's eye and emphasize the playful tension and dynamic relationships in the story. This project highlights my ability to merge custom illustration with thoughtful design to visually convey narrative, tone, and personality.
