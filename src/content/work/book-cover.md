### Project Description

This project is a creative exploration of modern, minimalist, and elegant book cover concepts for Jane Austen's classic novel Pride and Prejudice. The goal was to re-imagine the iconic title through a series of distinct visual identities that feel contemporary yet timeless, while preserving the romantic, witty, and literary spirit of the original work.

### Design Process

The process began with collecting visual and typographic inspiration. Sketching and Illustrator exploration were then used to develop and refine multiple cover concepts, focusing on composition, hierarchy, and the book's symbolism.
