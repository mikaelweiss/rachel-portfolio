For this project, I created a unique set of playing cards that combines classic card design with a modern aesthetic. Drawing inspiration from the vibrant color palette used in my Paula Scher brochure design, I crafted each card to be both functional and visually striking.

The deck features custom illustrations for the face cards, incorporating bold geometric patterns and a carefully selected color scheme that creates visual harmony throughout the set. Each suit has its own distinct personality while maintaining cohesion with the overall design language.

I paid special attention to the typography and symbolism, ensuring that the cards remain easily readable during gameplay while offering an elevated artistic experience. The back design of the cards features an intricate pattern that complements the face designs and adds to the deck's premium feel.

This project allowed me to explore the balance between traditional playing card conventions and contemporary design principles, resulting in a deck that's both practical for use and beautiful to display.
